SOTAwatch filter
================

## Description

[SOTAwatch filter] (http://www.mathieudavid.org/webapps/sotawatchfilter/#/spotfilter) is a web application that gives you the ability to filter "spots" from [SOTAwatch.org](http://www.sotawatch.org/) based on some criteria like callsigns, summits, frequency, etc. 

You can find the page online at: http://www.mathieudavid.org/webapps/sotawatchfilter/#/spotfilter
*This repository is only to show the code behind the page and if someone wants to contribute*

#### If you want to learn, fiddle or contribute to SOTAwatch filter here is how:

**If it is not already done, install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)**

**Fork**

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone your fork on your hard drive
3. Open the folder in your terminal
4. type ```npm install``` to install the dependencies

**Make changes**

Now you are ready to make changes. When you made a change you will want to run Grunt. Type ```grunt``` in the terminal. This will 'compile' (concatenate, minify, ...) the last changes. To see your changes open your browser and open *index.html* in the 'production' folder.

Alternatively you can type ```grunt watch``` in the terminal before you make any changes. In this case grunt will watch the files and when you modify a file grunt will run it's magic automaticaly.

> The only files you will want to modify are the ones in the *development* folder.

**Pull Request**

When you feel you have made substantial improvements, you can (and should :wink:) make a pull request so that I can review your additions and add your improvements for the benefit of the whole SOTA community !
